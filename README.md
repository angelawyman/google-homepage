<h1>Hi! I'm Angela Wyman.</h1>

Angela is an engaging NYC instructor with over 15 years of experience in design, art and technology. A graduate from Pratt Institute and Hunter College, she is on a mission to make computer science a bit more intelligible to the average person. She likes aquavit, is a freckled Peruvian transplant, and currently lives in Williamsburg Brooklyn with her tiny robot building son. In her free time she volunteer teaches her skills, lifts kettle bells and loves to draw on make-a-plates. Feel free to follow me on twitter and I will follow you back!
